# Sovereign
A community of self-governing people.

Develop a system by which a people may create and perform functions and services currently only accessable by government and/or corporate entities, but privately and cooperatively via a PEOPLES and controlled system.

Such a system may include processes for self-identification, individual data (photo's, bio-data, lawful documents, contracts, buy-sells, etc.). Also, candidate, voter, election system(s), judicial and court systems, as well as legislative and executive systems. All will be based on core principals, values, and Constitutional laws of the founding principals for the United States of America as the Republic.

The core founding principals at law are; 
  1) It is the Individual whom is the sovereign, not any State. As stated in law, they are sovereigns without subjects with no one to govern but themself.
  2) The rights of the many are no more than the combined rights of the one.  Such is the difference of a Republic in which the individual people (individually and collectively) rule themselves rather than a Democracy model in which the 51% rule the 49% (in theory anyway).
